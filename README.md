# ProcDumpWrapper
A GUI around the SysInternals ProcDump tool

ProcDump is a very useful tool from the SysInternals team at Microsoft.  I've found it difficult, however, to remember all of the available
command line options, which order they must be in, and which other options they're compatible with.

This project is an attempt to put a GUI around the tool so that it's easy to generate the correct command line every time.
